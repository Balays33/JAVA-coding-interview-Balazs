## Tips

- Check this **[Golden](https://tinyurl.com/uboo399)** post first.
- Whenever you solve a new question with some new techniques/algorithms, try to solve atleast 2 similar problem in a row. This way, your understanding to the new techniques/algorithms will be better.

1. Two Sum

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    Example:

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1]

2. Max Consecutive Ones

    Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

    Example 1: Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1] Output: 3 Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3. Note:

    The input array will only contain 0 and 1. The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
    
3.  Number Complement

    Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
    Example 1:

    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

    Example 2:

    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

    Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
    This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
    
4.   Hamming Distance

      The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

      Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

      Note:
      0 ≤ x, y < 231.

      Example:

      Input: x = 1, y = 4

      Output: 2

      Explanation:
      1   (0 0 0 1)
      4   (0 1 0 0)
             ↑   ↑

      The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
